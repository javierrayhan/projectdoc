# Documentation Hub

Welcome to the official documentation for all of my tech projects from embedded systems and BLE keyboards, to low-level OS experimentation and beyond. This space is designed as a central knowledge base to help **you (or future me)** understand, build, and improve every part of my work.

> _This page is dedicated exclusively for documentation purposes._  
If you’re here for source code, demos, or downloads, check the appropriate repos linked inside each section.

## What’s Inside?
You'll find docs on:
- ESP32 Projects (BLE, IoT, OLED, SDCard, and more)
- Custom Keyboards & Macro Pads
- ATmega32 Basic Operating System experiments
- Communication Protocols (LoRa, BLE, UART, etc.)
- Custom dev boards, schematics, and hardware builds

Each page is meant to be clear, concise, and usable, both for me and for anyone who wants to understand how it all works under the hood.
