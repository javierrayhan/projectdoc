### Minimum Requirements

- **Voltage Tolerance**: 5V regulated (recommended via AMS1117 or similar LDO)
- **I2C Level Compatibility**: OLED display must support 5V I2C lines if ATmega runs at 5V
- **Pull-up Resistors**: Required for stable rotary encoder reading & NTC sensing
- **Relay Rating**: Make sure relay can handle your heating elementâ€™s current (e.g. 5A/250VAC)
