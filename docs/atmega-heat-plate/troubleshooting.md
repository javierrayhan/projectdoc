Here's some solution maybe you'll need!

### Upload failed on ATmega8
Ensure the bootloader is burned and the correct fuse bits are set. For bare chips, you may need an external ISP programmer.

### Display not responding
Double-check your I2C wiring and address. Most OLEDs use 0x3C, but yours may differ.

### Thermistor values not accurate
Recalibrate or confirm the BETA value from the datasheet (recommended: B3950).
