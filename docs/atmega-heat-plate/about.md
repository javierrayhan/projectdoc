The **Heat Plate Controller OLED/16x2 I2C** is a compact, microcontroller-based solution for precise temperature regulation. It utilizes a thermistor to read real-time temperature and a relay module to control the heating element, ensuring accurate thermal stability.

### Features
- **Microcontroller-based logic** (ATmega328/168/8 compatible)
- **Display Options**: OLED SSD1306 or 16x2 LCD via I2C
- **Rotary Encoder**: for smooth temperature setpoint adjustment
- **Thermistor Feedback Loop**: real-time temperature sensing
- **Relay-Controlled Output**: toggles heater based on setpoint
- **EEPROM support**: saves last temperature setting

### Use Cases
- DIY soldering iron or reflow plate controller
- Compact heating modules for lab projects
- Educational kits for PID-like control systems

### Operation
Users interact with the system using a rotary encoder to set the target temperature. The current and target temperatures are displayed on an OLED or LCD, and the relay activates or deactivates the heater accordingly to maintain the set value.
