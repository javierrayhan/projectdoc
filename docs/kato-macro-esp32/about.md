## About This Project

This project is more than just a keyboard, it’s a compact, powerful, and personal input device designed to make your daily digital workflows smoother, faster, and a lot cooler. Built around the ESP32, this macro keyboard fuses customizability, minimalism, and modern embedded tech into a sleek stacked PCB sandwich.

Born out of a deep passion for coding, electronics, and clean UX, this is not your average macro pad. Whether you're a developer, a video editor, a gamer, or a multitasking creative, this is your digital sidekick. You define the workflow, it delivers the action.

## Use Cases
- Digital Creators: Map common tools like brush, eraser, undo, and export to the keys while using the knob to control brush size or opacity in apps like Photoshop or Illustrator.
- Video Editors: Control playback speed, jump cuts, or timeline zoom with the rotary encoder and assign hotkeys for split, ripple delete, and more.
- Developers: Automate repetitive terminal commands, switch between tabs, or trigger custom scripts and build actions with a single tap.
- Mobile Workflow: Connect to your phone or tablet via BLE to control music, launch shortcuts, or type predefined text blocks.
- Gamers: Map keys for quick access to inventory, skills, or macros during gameplay all without reaching for the full keyboard.
- Tinkerers & Makers: Experiment with new firmware ideas, try out custom layouts, or integrate the macro pad with other projects.

## Features
