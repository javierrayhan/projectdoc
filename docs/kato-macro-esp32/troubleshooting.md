Troubleshooting common issues with your ESP32 macro keyboard build.

## 1. Try Some Solutions

### Cannot connect with devices (BLE issue)

If you're using `bleKeyboard.h` and the device can't connect:

* Try removing and re-adding the BLE connection logic. Re-initiate the BLE setup.
* Make sure `BLEDevice::init()` is only called once and with a unique name.
* Disconnect from all previously paired devices before reconnecting.
* Check if your ESP32 is properly advertising.


### EEPROM Error

* Some ESP32 boards don't support traditional EEPROM emulation. Check the flash size.
* Make sure `EEPROM.begin(size)` is called before accessing.
* Confirm you're using `EEPROM.commit()` after writing data.
* Try using `Preferences.h` as an alternative for non-volatile storage.


### Keeps Restarting

* Could be caused by missing decoupling capacitors. Try placing 0.1ÂµF near the ESP32â€™s VCC and GND.
* Voltage regulator (like AMS1117 or ME6211) might be failing or overheating.
* Check power source â€” unstable USB power can cause brownout resets.
* Review your code for stack overflows or watchdog triggers.

### Cannot Upload Code

* Make sure the correct COM port is selected in Arduino/PlatformIO.
* Press and hold BOOT (GPIO0) during upload to manually enter flash mode.
* Check USB cable â€” some are power-only.
* Close any serial monitors using the port.

### Other Common Problems

* **Encoder not working:** check that the pins are not floating,use 10kÎ© pull-up resistors.
* **Buttons donâ€™t register:** verify the matrix wiring and debounce logic.
* **BLE HID not detected on Mac/iOS:** restart Bluetooth, unpair old device, re-pair again.
* **Overheating ESP32:** make sure current draw doesnâ€™t exceed regulator specs, use heat sinks or lower LED brightness.

When in doubt, strip it down to minimal code and test each part individually. Small steps = clear debugging path.
